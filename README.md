# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The company Pewlett-Hackard is looking for a better way to organize the data related to the employees organization. 
The most important result from this re-organization will be to find out which position needs to be fill out in the future. 
After a first overview of the data relationship between employees, department and roles  we received an additional request to find the number of reitiring employees by title and identify who can be elegible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results

### Results based on the number of retiring employees by title. 

1. Senior Enginner position: This is the most affected group for the first analysis. The 29,414 employees with the Senior Engineer title represent the 32.53% of the entire table:

This result can be considered as critical because the engineering level is granted by experience. Having that key role affected could impact the engineering department for the entire company. 

2. Manager position: Having this position as the less affected group on the results can be considered as good news for the company. Since this is a key role, it usually requires an extensive knowledge of the organization and the different department tasks.

### Employees eligibile for the mentorship program

1. The total number of employees eligible for the mentorship program is 1549. This is a great result considering that the company only has 9 departments, it is possible to planify the training sessions in advance.

2. Mentorship program by title: If we count the number of possible mentors for each title category, "Technique Leader" obtains the lowest number. 
We suggest to evaluate the mentorship program as soon as possible for this group and for the Senior Engineer role because this title will be in high demand for new employees and the number of mentors is not the best neither (only 169).

## Summary

1. Mentorship by gender: I created a table to analyze the candidates for the mentorship program based on the gender.

The female gender represent the 41.5%, this is an important result because it shows the equal opportunity in the company. This result can be considered as an addional criteria for the new interview process to increase the number of female employees. 

2. Risk for the top engineering position: The table "Retiring employees by title", shows a critical problem for the engineering department. More than 40,000 position (combining Senior Engineer and Engineer), will be vacant. It is very important start a hiring program with trainings periods.

3. Top salaries: This query creates a table including the salary average for the retiring employees by title. This result can give us an idea about the budget for the new hiring process and adjust some of them to offer a competitive salary in the market.
